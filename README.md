# Forest-Fire-Analysis

# Overview

This project aims to analyze forest fire data to gain insights into the causes and consequences of forest fires. The dataset used for this analysis includes variables such as weather conditions, fire behavior, and spatial location.

# Data Source
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires

# Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following variables:

- X and Y coordinates
- Month and Day of the fire
- FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code)
- DMC (Duff Moisture Code)
- DC (Drought Code)
- ISI (Initial Spread Index)
- TEMP (Temperature)
- RH (Relative Humidity)
- WIND (Wind speed)
- RAIN (Rainfall)
- AREA (Area burned by the fire)

# Analysis

The analysis includes:

- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables
- Regression analysis to model the relationship between weather variables and fire behavior
- Spatial analysis to understand the distribution of fires

# Tools used
- Microsoft Excel
- SQL
- PowerBi
